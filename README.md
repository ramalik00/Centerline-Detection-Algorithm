# Centerline Detection Algorithm
 This is project under CSM 391 (Stream Project) aimed to omprove the Centerline Detection Algorithm for the Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation as described in the following research paper [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339127922_A_fractional_filter_and_centerline_detection_based_efficient_algorithm_for_retinal_blood_vessel_segmentation) 
 
 The aim of this project is to improve the algorithm for the centerline detection algorithm using existing state of the art techniques which can achieve higher accuracy than the existing centerline detection algorithm as mentioned in the paper above .
 ## Running the project on your System
   1. First install all the MATLAB environment on your system . 
   2. Now simply run the main.m file and pass in your image to which you wish to apply the centerline detection algorithm
